PHP-HabitRPG-API
================

A PHP version of the HabitRPG API.  Will be expanded when more features become available in the API.

##[Habit Scoring] (https://github.com/lefnire/habitrpg/wiki/API)

###Example request: http://hackst.com/#WMw1F

Send the data to your server or through mine with a POST containing the require parameters, and receive a JSON return containing the results of the POSt (success/failure and attached HabitRPG data).

##Why use this PHP version?

Well, for one thing it's one less thing for you to manage, I already have a server to use, and you don't have to worry about construction cURLs, or anything like that.  You are just able to POST the data to an endpoint.

Also, this may be more useful for desktop/mobile applications, but who knows.  I put this together, use it if you'd like.

###**NOTE: You do not need to use this API with POSTs... you could define any values statically.**
